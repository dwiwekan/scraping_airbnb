# Airbnb Data in Bali January 2023

Engaged in a dynamic project at the Badan Pusat Statistik Provinsi Bali in January 2023, I undertook a comprehensive scraping initiative. Employing Beautiful Soup and Selenium, I meticulously gathered Airbnb data across all regencies in Bali. The outcome: a robust dataset of over 4500 clean entries. This initiative played a pivotal role in supporting the BPS Ninja Team's efforts to survey hotels not present in their existing database, showcasing the power of web scraping in real-world applications.
